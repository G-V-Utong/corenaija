# üì≤ App Flow Document: CoreNaija

The user opens the app and lands on the **Splash Screen**, which displays the CoreNaija logo with a smooth animated transition. After a few seconds, the user is automatically directed to the **Onboarding Screen** if they are a new user, or to the **Login Screen** if they have used the app before.

## Onboarding Flow (First-time users only)

The **Onboarding Screen** contains a short 3-step walkthrough. The user swipes through screens that explain the app's value, such as "Personalized Fitness", "Nigerian Meal Plans", and "Earn Rewards for Working Out". At the end of the walkthrough, the user taps ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù, which takes them to the **Account Setup Screen**.

On the **Account Setup Screen**, the user chooses to either **Sign up with email**, **Sign up with phone (OTP)**, or **Continue with Google**. After successful registration, the user proceeds to the **Fitness Goal Setup Screen**.

On the **Fitness Goal Setup Screen**, the user selects one of the predefined goals: Lose Weight, Build Muscle, Improve Stamina, or Maintain Health. Then the user enters their age, gender, height, weight, fitness level, and dietary preference. After submitting, the AI generates a starter workout and a meal plan suggestion, and the user is directed to the **Home Screen**.
